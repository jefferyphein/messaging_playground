This example is intended to be a very brief demonstration of RabbitMQ queues.

This code was slightly modified from the official RabbitMQ documentation, which
can be found here:

    https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html

(1) Run "python send.py" to submit a message to a queue. You can run this
    command as many times as you like, each message will get put into a queue
    to await later consumption.

(2) Run "python receive.py" to subscribe to the queue and both pull down any
    back log of messages, as well as any new messages.

(3) While Step 2 is running, run "python send.py" again and observe that each
    time this is run, a "Hello World!" message appears on the receiving end.
