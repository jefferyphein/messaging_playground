Run "make" to build both a simple publisher and simple subscriber.

The subscriber subscribes to a pre-defined topic, and waits until it receives
"This is the last message." before it unsubscribes and exits.

The publisher publishes "Hello, World!" ten times, followed by the terminal
"This is the last message." and exits.

Note that if you start the publisher before the subscriber, not all messages
will be received by the subscriber.
