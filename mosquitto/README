(1) Run "mosquitto" on a machine to set up the broker. By default it runs on
    port 1883 in non-TLS mode and port 8883 in TLS mode.

(2) Once the broker is running, in separate terminals on the same machine, you
    can run the pub/sub binaries to test it out.

    To subscribe to a topic:

        mosquitto_sub -t topic

    To publish to a topic:

        mosquitto_pub -t topic -m "Hello, World!"

    You should see "Hello, World!" appear on the subscriber terminal if
    everything is configured correctly. You'll also see the publish client
    connect and disconnect on the broker terminal.

(3) If you run two subscribers and then publish a message, you will see the
    message appear on both subscriber windows. There is no way to "distribute"
    this work as with RabbitMQ. However, there is a hierarchy to topics. Try
    the following...

    Two subscribers (same machine, different terminals):

        mosquitto_sub -t topic/a
        mosquitto_sub -t topic/b

    One publisher, two messages:

        mosquitto_sub -t topic/a -m "Hello, Topic A!"
        mosquitto_sub -t topic/b -m "Hello, Topic B!"

    This allows you to selectively subscribe to topics of interest, but under
    the same "topic" tree.

    Topic hierarchy is separated with forward slashes / and can be arbitrarily
    long. For example, a very specific topic could have a hierarchy organized
    as follows "<author>/<book>/<page>" that lets you subscribe to a specific
    page of a specific book from a specific author.

(4) You can also subscribe to specific topic pattern. Try the following...

    One subscriber:

        mosquitto_sub -t topic/+

    One publisher, three messages:

        mosquitto_pub -t topic/a -m "Hello, Topic A!"
        mosquitto_pub -t topic/b -m "Hello, Topic B!"
        mosquitto_pub -t topic/c/blah -m "Hello, Topic C (blah)!"

    The subscriber should only get the first two messages, but not the third.
    This is because + only matches one level of topic wild cards. However, if
    the subscriber subscribed as follows

        mosquitto_sub -t topic/#

    it would see all three messages, since # wild card expansion is multi-level.
