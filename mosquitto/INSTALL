(1) Build and install cJSON to PREFIX.

        cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$PREFIX .
        make
        make install

(2) Build and install mosquitto to PREFIX as a static binary.

        cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$PREFIX .
        CPATH=$PREFIX/include make WITH_DOCS=no WITH_WEBSOCKETS=no WITH_STATIC_LIBRARIES=yes
        make install

    This will place libmosquitto.so into $PREFIX/lib64, and so you may need to
    add $PREFIX/lib64 to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

(3) Not sure why, but it doesn't actually install the actual mosquitto broker
    to your $PREFIX/bin path. Upon succesfully building the binary, there is
    also the broker at "src/mosquitto".

        cp src/mosquitto $PREFIX/bin
