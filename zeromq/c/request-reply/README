This example demonstrates a simple request-reply pattern using ZeroMQ.

This code was copied directly from the official ZeroMQ documentation:

    https://zeromq.org/languages/c/#libzmq

(1) Build the client/server executables by simply running "make"

(2) In separate terminals, run

        ./server
        ./client

    The client will then connect to the server via TCP on port 5555 and send a
    "Hello" message to the server then wait for the server to respond with a
    "World" message response. The server simulates work latency by sleeping for
    one second before sending its response. The client sends 10 of these
    messages before exiting.
