(1) You will need "cmake" to build the ZeroMQ source code from the official
    ZeroMQ Github page available here:

        https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq

(2) First, you must create a build directoy off of the source root directory,
    otherwise cmake will yell at you and fail. In the source root directory,
    run the following commands:

        mkdir -p cmake/build
        cd cmake/build
        cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PREFIX ../..
        make -j8
        make install

    If you don't want a shared library, include -DBUILD_SHARED=OFF to the
    cmake command above.

    This installs the libzmq libraries to $PREFIX/lib64, and so you may need
    to add that path to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH and/or LIBRARY_PATH when linking
    against this library.
