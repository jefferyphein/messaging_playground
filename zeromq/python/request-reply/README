This example demonstrates a simple request-reply pattern using ZeroMQ.

This code was copied directly from the official ZeroMQ documentation:

    https://zeromq.org/languages/python/

(1) In separate terminals run

        python server.py
        python client.py

    The client will connect to the server via TCP on port 555 and send a
    "Hello" message to the server and await a response. The server, responds to
    each incoming request with a "World" message after sleeping for one second
    to simulate work latency. The client sends a total of 10 "Hello" messages
    before exiting.
