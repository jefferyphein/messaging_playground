This is a simple demonstration of a remote graceful shutdown service.

To run, simply run the following two commands in separate windows in any order:

    python service.py
    python shutdown.py

The service.py script awaits a shutdown command from the shutdown.py script.

The shutdown.py script connects to the shutdown servers and then issues a
shutdown command.
